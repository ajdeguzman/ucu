Organized by the Google Development Group (GDG) Philippines, the Project D Coders of the College of Computer Studies (CCS) grabbed the championship award in the Social Good Category of the Android Master 2018 held last November 17 at the Tech Portal, UP Ayala Land TechnoHub, Quezon City, Philippines.

Dubbed as “ElemixAr”, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) students namely Analyn P. Jadia, Paul Jenrice H. Tan, and Jefferson C. Macabio developed this application with the help of their coach, Mr. Danilo B. Dorado, LPT, MIT.

In addition, the team sacked various awards such as the Best Presenters, the Best Booth of the Year, and the Most Downloaded Application.

“One for all, all for one; we need to give our best dahil mahal namin ang UCU (Urdaneta City University) and as much as possible, we want to put our university on the top — na ang magagaling na programmers ay hindi lang sa Manila matatagpuan kun’di mayroon din tayong humble university, which is UCU, na kaya ding makipagsabayan,” said Mr. Dorado in an interview.

ElemixAr is an android-based augmented reality learning environment intended for chemistry subject where learning chemical elements is beyond limits. This application aims to intensify the science learning of all Filipino students and boosts their confidence in learning chemistry, making it more interactive and interesting.

“Nakakatuwa at nakaka-proud dahil naglalakihang universities ‘yong mga kalaban namin pero kami ‘yong tinanghal na champion; all our sacrifices were eventually paid off,” said Jadia.

Last 2016 and 2017, it can be recalled that UCU also garnered the spotlight in developing android applications with its applications “Nutrivision” and “DashFun”, respectively, where the latter was hailed as champion and the Most Downloaded Application, and the former entered the Top 5 finalists and was declared the Most Downloaded Application.

“The success of this project is not an individual achievement, but [an] achievement of all,” said Mrs. Rubilyn R. Nonales, LPT, MIT, Dean of the CCS, in an interview.

Meanwhile, placing second and third place were Cebu Institute of Technology University and Malayan Colleges Laguna with their applications “AEON” and “Signus”, respectively.

The main objective of the said event is to encourage IT students to develop application to be published and marketed on the Google Play Store that will gauge the needs of society.#
