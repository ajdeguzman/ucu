Student Council Candidates proved that they are worth voting as they answered several questions during the UCU's version of Harapan 2019 yesterday, February 18 at the University Gymnasium.

The UCU community convened to witness the views and opinions of the hopefuls from Achieving Change to Empower Students (ACES) led by its president, Luz Clarita Tebangen (BS Tourism) and Alliance of Concerned and Transformed Students (ACTS) headed by Mark Darwin Sampilo (BS Pharmacy).

The Q and A tackled the issues and problems of the university and their proposals to such. Some of them were RA 10931 GWA and grades cap, waste management, and particularly, the students' behavior in social media.

In addition, they also voiced their opinions on the current issues of the nation such as poverty, lowering the age of criminal liability, Bangsamoro Organic Law, etc.

Following the panel format of questioning, each batch of three candidates per party would be given 1 minute to answer the first question, and 30 seconds to answer each follow up questions.

Present in the event were the seven panelists coming from the studentry and administration to test the intellectuality of the aspirants.

Ms. Missy Kyle Flores (4th Year Communication Student), Mr. John Mark Taguian (JPIA President), Mark Joven Aquino (Editor-in-Chief, The University Scribe) composed the Student Leaders panelists.

While, Mr. Jefferson Delmendo (Former President Politicus Scientia Societas), Ms. Anilyn M. Tabara (OIC - Student Affairs and Services), Mr. Jojo Shenker (Student Council Adviser) and Ms. Jocelyn Espino (Presidential Assistant for Quality Assurance) completed the set of faculty panelists.

Students were also given a chance to ask queries to each candidate.

"Nakatulong ang debate sa pagkilala namin sa kanila (candidates) sapagkat nabatid ng magkabilang partido ang kani-kanilang plataporma at nalaman ko rin ang kanilang capabilities in running as candidates", Reynalyn Candila BSBA-1 when asked on how does the event helped her on choosing student leaders.

Joshua Fidel, President of Kapisanan ng Filipino, also responded, "nakatulong nang napakalaki ang debate sa pagpili ng mga future leaders sa school kasi isa-isa kong nalaman yung kanilang plataporma't adhikain na magagamit upang maging maganda ang UCU sa kinabukasan".
