Lingayen, Pangasinan- Urdaneta City University Music Ensemble made a mark in the province upon performing in the Centennial Celebration of the Capitol Building with the theme "Stronger Heritage, Stronger Pangasinan" on December 15, 2018.

Led by Mr. Jonathan Lastimado, Choirmaster, 35 students united their voices as they rendered three songs, namely; "Handog" by Florante, "Si Ka Bayani" by Gary Granada, and "From Now On" from The Greatest Showman.

“All the performers in the event were champions and achievers of their ventures. It was an honor for UCU since we were chosen to be part of this remarkable event. Knowing that the provincial government recognizes us is a milestone for all UCUians,” Mr. Lastimado said in an interview.

He also added that “UCU-ME only had one day to rehearse since the invitation was not given in advance, and the UCU Executive Chorale Concert was my priority (by that time).”

Mr. Louie Ocampo, Director of the event, expressed his commendations to the group even though the choir was composed mostly of new members.

“There is no better chorale I know who can do justice to the tribute that has been prepared for the iconic personalities of Pangasinan other than the UCU Music Ensemble. They were great as they gave us a world class performance to honor our fellow Pangasinenses.”

“Most importantly, their songs made me feel proud to be a Pangasinense. They are more than perfect to be part of the Capitol Building’s Centennial Celebration”, he added.

“Nakaka overwhelm kasi kahit bago palang ako sa choir, nagkaroon agad ako ng chance para makasama sa ganito kalaking event,” Eljohn Villa, choir member, stated.

Moreover, a former UCU student in the person of Rica Mae C. Maer was also invited to perform as one of the lead singers.

“Nakaka overwhelm kasi hindi ko expect na mai invite ako sa ganito kalaking event. Nakakatuwa kasi naipakita ko yung talent ko sa maraming tao”, she exclaimed.

Included in the celebration were the different production numbers from various artists and performing groups.

Also, one of the highlights was the projection mapping flashed at the building itself. #
