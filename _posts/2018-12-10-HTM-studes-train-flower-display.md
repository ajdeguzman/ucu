Students from the College of Hospitality and Tourism Management (CHTM) organized and attended seminar-workshop on flower arrangement titled, “December Ikebana: A Petal, Leaf, and Stem Sculpture by Master DC” held on December 10, 2018 at the University Gym.

Event organizers invited Mr. Dandi Arjona Carao, a well-known florist and owner of DC Paper Flowers in Baguio City, as the guest lecturer of the said event.

Known as “Master DC,” he imparted his knowledge on flower arrangement in revealing different types according to patterns and color combinations.

He also demonstrated the circular flower arrangement with the use of different ornaments such as carnations and roses, stems, and leaves; it was also applied in the workshop by the participants.

In an ambush interview, Mr. Carao, the guest lecturer himself emphasized the importance of flower arrangement in the field of Hospitality and Tourism Management.

“Sa field ng HTM kasi, in-demand ang flower arrangement, and flower symbolizes hospitality,” he stressed.

According to John Alfred Gelano, BS HRM-IV and event organizer, his co-department members arranged the venue and the flow of the program with the supervision of Ms. Tricia Lyn Tuliao, instructor of CHTM.

Ms. Tuliao mentioned the importance of attending the seminar-workshop.

“Makakatulong ang seminar na ito sa mga bata kasi importante ang flower arrangement sa pag-se-set up ng mga occasions like weddings and parties,” Tuliao said.

“Kailangan naming matutunan ‘to (flower arrangement) para kung sakaling mag-OJT kami, mayroon na kaming experience at magagamay na namin ito in the future,” Neil Kenneth Tamana, BSHMCA – I student, told. #
